## TO-DOs

- [ ] Analyze the random effects for each attribute-level pair (or at least the most important ones) [Lines 218-244]
- [ ] Check whether Sensitivity Chart can be adapted to model2.mixed2 (best fitting model)
- [ ] Managerial Decisions (none of this was properly done so far, only sparce intents)
- [ ] IDEA: Create customer clusters to target marketing and/or establish offers programatically (this wasn't seen in the course but we know how to do it and IMO would be a very nice extra, something else than just adapting his code to our dataset)
