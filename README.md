# Choice-Based Conjoint Analysis for Vacation Preferences

This repository presents an analysis of vacation preferences using **Choice-Based Conjoint Analysis (CBC)** and advanced statistical modeling. The study employs **Multinomial Logit (MNL)** and **Mixed Logit Models** to explore consumer decision-making and extract actionable insights for product design and marketing.

Key tools such as **Likelihood Ratio Tests**, **Preference Shares**, and **Sensitivity Charts** are applied to validate models and derive actionable insights. The synthetic dataset focuses on attributes like price, duration, accommodation, transport, and destination. While the vacation scenario is illustrative, the methodologies are generalizable across domains.

The study is based on a synthetic dataset simulating vacation package choices. While the data is illustrative, the methods are applicable across various fields such as marketing, product design, and behavioral economics.
